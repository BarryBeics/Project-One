This is the personal web development site for Barry Marples. As a junior developer this site will serve as a space to showcase work so that prospective employers and collaborators alike can see if Barry is right for their next big project.
 
You can visit the deployed website [here](https://barrybeics.github.io/Project-One/).

## 1. UX
---
 
### 1.1. Project Goals ###
 
This website has been designed for myself, so that I can build an online presence. The ultimate aim of this would be to get paid work by either personal clients or be contacted by recruiters which would be achieved by using the contact form.
 
### 1.2. User Stories ###
 
- As an owner, I want to showcase skills I have and give examples of previous work to attract more clients.
- As an owner, I want the possibility for prospective clients and recruiters to contact me easily.
- As a user, I want to be able to get in touch with the developer for any reason.
- As a user, I want to be able to view skills and examples of past work.
- As a user, I want to be able to see the developers social media presence.
- As a recuiter, I want to easily get a copy of the developers CV.
- As a curious user, I want to know more about the developer in terms of career history.
- As a potential client with specific project goals I want to easily communicate my project.
 
 
### 1.3. Design ###
 
- **Colour Scheme**: The colours have been selected to compliment the original graphic which features on every page of the site.
 
<h2 align="center"><img src="./assets/images/header-graphic.png"><img src="./readme-docs/palette.png"></h2>
 
- Kingfisher Turquoise #79b4b7 - This forms the colour of the navigation section, sitewide background, h2 & h3 tags
- Home Plate #f8f0df - This is used as the background of the section area, nav & socials icons
- Black Olive #3b3b38 - This used for the footer, text and the selected nav icons
- Golden West #e9cf96 - This is used in the footer text
- Litewood #e5decf - This is used for a contrast panels
 
- **Typography**: The Montserrat font is the main font used throughout the whole website with Sans Serif as the fallback font in case for any reason the font isn't being imported into the site correctly. Montserrat is a clean font used frequently in programming, so it is both attractive and appropriate.
 
- **Imagery**: This simple clean site design only contains one graphic of a character of Barry busy working at his desk. This graphic is overlaid with 2 animated gifs.
of a fresh steaming cup of coffee 
The talking mouth and blinking eyes of the character.
 
### 1.4. Wireframes ###
 
The wireframes for this site were produced in Balsamiq (https://balsamiq.com/). Wire frames were created for Desktop, Tablet & mobile respectively.
you will see the final site changed due to the concept not working well as expected in reality.
  
This required some reconfiguration of the layout using the bootstrap elements.
