        -   The colours have been selected to compliment the original graphic which features on every page of the site. 

        <br />

        <h2 align="center"><img src="./assets/images/header-graphic.png"><img src="./readme-docs/palette.png"></h2>

        -   Kingfisher Turquoise #79b4b7 - This forms the colour of the navigation section, sitewide background, h2 & h3 tags

        -   Litewood #e5decf - This is used for a contrast panels

        <br />


    -   #### Typography
        -   The Montserrat font is the main font used throughout the whole website with Sans Serif as the fallback font in case for any reason the font isn't being imported into the site correctly. Montserrat is a clean font used frequently in programming, so it is both attractive and appropriate.

        <br />

    -   #### Imagery
        -   This simple clean site design only contains one images of a character of Barry busy working at his desk. This imaged is overlaid with 2 animated gifs. 
of a fresh steaming cup of coffee and 2. The talking mouth and blinking eyes of the character.

    you will see the final site changed due to the concept not working well in reality. 
    
        This required so reconfiruation of the layout using the bootstrap elemnts.
