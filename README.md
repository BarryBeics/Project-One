## 1. UX
---

### 1.1. Project Goals ###

This website has been designed for myself, so that I can build and online presence. The ultimate aim of this would be to get paid work by either personal clients or be contacted by recruiters which would be achieved when they use the contact form.

### 1.2. User Stories ###

- As an owner, I want to showcase skills I have and give examples of previous work to attract more clients.
- As an owner, I want the possibility for propective clients and recruiters to contact me easily.
- As an owner, I want my website to be easily recognisable.
- As a user, I want to be able to get in touch with the developer for any reason.
- As a user, I want to be able to view skills and examples of past work.
- As a curious user, I want to know more about the developer in terms of career history.
- As a potential client with specific project goals I want to easily communicate my project.


### 1.3. Design ###

- **Colour Scheme**: The colours have been selected to compliment the original graphic which features on every page of the site. 

<h2 align="center"><img src="./assets/images/header-graphic.png"><img src="./readme-docs/palette.png"></h2>

- Kingfisher Turquoise #79b4b7 - This forms the colour of the navigation section, sitewide background, h2 & h3 tags
- Home Plate #f8f0df - This is used as the background of the section area, nav & socials icons
- Black Olive #3b3b38 - This used for the footer, text and the selected nav icons
- Golden West #e9cf96 - This is used in the footer text
- Litewood #e5decf - This is used for a contrast panels

- **Typography**: The Montserrat font is the main font used throughout the whole website with Sans Serif as the fallback font in case for any reason the font isn't being imported into the site correctly. Montserrat is a clean font used frequently in programming, so it is both attractive and appropriate.

- **Imagery**: This simple clean site design only contains one images of a character of Barry busy working at his desk. This imaged is overlaid with 2 animated gifs. 
of a fresh steaming cup of coffee and 2. The talking mouth and blinking eyes of the character.

### 1.4. Wireframes ###

The wireframes for this site were produced in Balsamiq (https://balsamiq.com/). Wire frames were created for Desktop, Tablet & mobile respectivaly. 
you will see the final site changed due to the concept not working well as expected in reality. 
    
This required some reconfiruation of the layout using the bootstrap elements.
